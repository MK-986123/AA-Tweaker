Additionally, this mode activates another feature that will turn the phone\'s screen in a second display for navigation in Android Auto.\n
Settings for tweaking this feature will be available in Android Auto homescreen.\n

    <string name="custom_wallpapers">Wallpapers</string>
    <string name="tutorial_wallpapers">This tweak will activate the new built in wallpaper changer in Android Auto. Android Auto 5.8 or superior is required.\nWARNING: If you are a user of Wallpapers For Android Auto, you will need to update it to at least version 3.0, otherwise this tweak will break Wallpapers For Android Auto functionality.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_dark_mode">Starting from December 2020, Google reverted a behaviour that happened since Android 10. Previously, the light/dark mode on Android Auto followed the light/dark mode on the phone and vice versa. This meant that switching the phone to dark mode had effect on the car, or if the phone was in dark mode and the car had lights off it used to switch on the light theme on the phone.\n However, since this feature of \"independent\" dark mode was introduced, users with Aftermarket headunits have no way to switch to dark mode anymore without actually wiring the stereo to the car\'s lights.\n This tweak makes sure that night mode is again dependent from phone and switching light/dark mode on phone will have its effects on cars too.</string>
    <string name="dark_mode_tweak">independent dark mode</string>
    <string name="telemetry_string">telemetry</string>
    <string name="tutorial_telemetry">It\'s no mystery that Google logs a lot of datas about us. This tweak will make so that Google Play Services will stop a lot of tracking and logging activity.\n
WARNING: This tweak has not been extensively tested and could potentially break Android Auto. If you find out that this tweak breaks Android Auto, please open an issue on GitHub.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_calendar_tweak">This tweak will make so that calendar app into Android Auto can show more days than just one. Please note that even increasing the number of days, it\'s still not obviously possible to distinguish which day you are viewing the events of. Android Auto will just show how many events are set in one day and it won\'t show which day it is.</string>

    <string name="no_accounts_warning">AA AIO TWEAKER could not find any account in Google Play Services database. This can be caused by several different things such as:\n • Device that is mostly not connected to internet\n • Fresh install of the phone\n • Corrupted Google Play Services database\n • Removal of Google account(s) from the phone\n • Cleared datas of Google Play Services\n\nIn this scenario, AA AIO TWEAKER will FAIL to work properly. If you recently removed a Google account or cleared Google Play Services datas, please keep the phone connected to internet and let it build the Google Play Services database fully. This might take several hours, in some cases also days.\n\nIf you are not in one of the above conditions, please open a issue on GitHub.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_bitrate">This tweak will increase or decrease video bitrate according to the multiplier set (up to 2.0x). Increasing the bitrate (more than 1.0x) will mean that more datas will be streamed to the car and quality of video streaming could be improved in visual quality, however it might cause instability. Decreasing the bitrate (less than 1.0x) will compress the stream to the car and quality will be decreased, but it will result in a more reliable and fast connection.</string>

    <string name="dark_switch_tweak">day/night option</string>
    <string name="tutorial_darkmodeswitch">This tweak will activate a dedicated toggle in Android Auto generic settings (both car and phone) that can control the status of day/night mode on Android Auto.

    <string name="tutorial_custom_startup_option">This tweak will activate a new option inside Android Auto\'s settings that will let the user set what to open when Android Auto is started.

    <string name="custom_hotseat_option">Custom seating option</string>
    <string name="tutorial_hotseat_option">This tweak will activate a new option inside Android Auto\'s settings that will let the user decide whether the driving position is left or right so that Android Auto can adapt its UI. Android Auto 6.9 or superior is required.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_coolwalk">This tweak will activate a new design in Android Auto (codename Coolwalk) that can be toggled in Android Auto\'s settings and that tweaks a bit the appearance on smaller screens.
